# DelayedNotifications
The DelayedNotification plugin consolidates and delays all notification emails and sends them out after preselected amount of time.
The idea is to reduce the amount of emails users get in an active forum.

This is mostly appropriate in forums where users subscribe to categories where content is constantly been generated (e.g. entries automatically added from RSS feeds).

Each user via their profile notification settings has control whether they want consolidated emails.
The forum administrator can set the delayed period - 12 hours, day, two days, etc.

This first version offers an all-or-nothing option - either all messages for a user are delayed, or none.  
Future versions may provide finer granularity on a per-category basis.

This plugin was developed through the collaboration of R_J and rbrahmson.
